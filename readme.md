# AI-Based Coral Reef Health Detector

Welcome to the AI-Based Coral Reef Health Detector! A project that proves even coral reefs need a doctor sometimes. 🌊🤖

---

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is designed to assess the health of coral reefs using AI. By analyzing images of coral reefs, the system predicts whether they are healthy or not. It's like a fitness tracker for the oceans, minus the motivational push notifications.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Analysis**: Upload images of coral reefs, and let our model work its magic.
- **Health Prediction**: Determine if the reef is healthy or needs attention.
- **Backend Powered by Python Flask**: Because who needs fancy buzzwords when Python does the job?
- **Machine Learning for Predictions**: The brains of the operation, trained with a lot of underwater data (no scuba diving required).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Custom model trained on coral reef datasets
- **Frontend**: (Optional, but feel free to add one if you’re feeling creative!)
- **Database**: Store image logs and predictions (if needed)

## 📋 Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saqib40/bmsHackathon.git
   cd coral-reef-health-detector
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Your app will be live at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## 🤔 How It Works
1. Upload an image of a coral reef.
2. The image is processed by our machine learning model.
3. The model predicts if the coral reef is healthy or not.
4. Display the results along with some fun facts about coral reefs. (Optional, but it’s nice to learn while saving the planet!)

## 📚 Future Enhancements
- 🌍 **Global Database**: Store and analyze coral reef health data worldwide.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Add charts to show trends in reef health.
- 🐠 **Marine Life Detection**: Identify fish and other marine species in the images.

## 🎉 Fun Fact
Did you know that coral reefs are home to 25% of all marine life? They're the underwater equivalent of a bustling metropolis, minus the traffic jams. Let’s help them stay healthy!
